Image Gallery Project with CSS

Overview

This project is a simple image gallery with 9 images. I have used basic CSS properties to learn how they work and what effects they create.

Key Features


Hover Effects: Images change slightly when you hover over them, such as zooming in or showing text.

Responsive Layout: The gallery adjusts to different screen sizes, so it looks good on phones and computers.

Simple CSS Styling: I've used properties like gradients, transitions, and transforms.

CSS Properties Used

Linear Gradients: Added to captions for a color effect.

Transitions: Used for smooth hover animations.

Transform: Slight zoom-in effect on hover.

Opacity: Controls visibility of text on images.

Positioning: Adjusted captions using absolute and relative positions.
